Definition:
	These are a little different to functions, although their application is different. Whereas functions are free-standing and often initiated globally, methods are members of a class.

Syntax:
	class ClassName {
		Data_type method_name( arguments );
	};

Examples:
	class Student {
		int get_age();
	}
