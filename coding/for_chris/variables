Definition:
	Variables are slots in memory used to store a value of a specified data type and declared using a name of your choice. Think of it as a container that holds something.
	Variable names can only contain letters or underscores( _ ), and number if it isn't the first character of the name.

	Depending on your programming teacher, there are two generally accepted conventions:
	thisNameOr
	this_name_or
	this_1s_name
	1_day

Syntax:
	Data_type name = value;

Common Types:
	integers:	int
	double:		double
	float:		float
	characters:	char
	string:		string

Examples:
	int num1 = 1;
	string stuff = "Hello World!";
	char c = 'c';
	double = 5.25;
	float = 5.25f;

There are many types of variables, and you can even create your own. For now, these will be the basic ones you'll learn.
