Definition:
	Comments are snippets of information used to guide fellow programmers. They are excluded during compile-time and therefore won't show up in the end program.

Syntax
	// comment

	/*  this is
	 *  a mult-line
	 *  comment
	 */ 

Examples:
class Comment {
public:
	method 1; // this is a comment example.
	...
private:
	/* this is a
	 * multiline
	 * comment
	 */

	variable 1;
	...
}
