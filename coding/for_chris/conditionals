Definition:
	In it's basic form, conditionals are how you program software to make decisions. If a condition is true, do this. If false, do that. There two main types: switch and if-else. you'll probably use if-else more than switch. both have their uses.

Syntax:
	switch( var ) {
		case 1:
			do something...
			break;
		case 2:
			do something else...
			break;
		...
	}

	if ( condition ) {
		do something
	}
	else {
		do something else
	}

	if ( 1st condition ) {
		do something
	} else if ( 2nd condition ) {
		do something else
	}

Types:
	Switch
		To test a condition against several cases.
	if-else
		The more basic conditional. you also get if-elseif.

Examples:
	switch('c') {
		case 'a':
			std::cout << "the letter a" << std::endl;
			break;
		case 'c':
			std::cout << "the letter c" << std::endl;
			break;
	}

if ( 1 >= 0 ) {
	std::cout << "one is greater than or equal to zero";
}
else {
	std::cout << "one is less than zero";
}

if ( 1 >= 0 ) {
	std::cout << "one is greater than or equal to zero";
} else if ( 1 < 0 ) {
	std::cout << "one is less than zero";
}
else {
	std::cout << "i will eat your brainz!!!";
}
