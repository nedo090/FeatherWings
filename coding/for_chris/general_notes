A few guidelines which I personally follow:

Functions:
	Keep your function declarations and definitions seperate.

Comments:
	Only use comments when your code is not obvious ( Code should be self documenting ).

Scope:
	Avoid using global variables, except with constants.

Naming:
	Name variables, classes and functions according to their use or function.
