CHAPTER 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kai Trevnets is smaller than the other boys his age.
Whether it was a blessing or a curse,
is left to be explored,
and Kai certainly didn't see it that way.
While he stopped growing,
the other boys and girls sprouted up like onions.
This fact made him a target for ridicule among his classmates.
he resented his size,
and he hated school.
there was only one thing aside from the promise he made with his mother that kept him going to school everyday.
Her name was Aurora Elizabeth.
She sat next to him in class,
and always smelt like cherries.
Of course,
someone with her feminine allure,
wouldn't be attractive to just one person.
rather,
she would be considered the most popular girl in the school,
if it weren't for one thing.
