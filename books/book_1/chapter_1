CHAPTER 1:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kai Trevnets is smaller than the other boys his age.
Whether it was a blessing or a curse,
is left to be explored,
and Kai certainly didn't see it that way.
Watching the other boys and girls sprout up like weeds,
he resented his size,
and was jealous of theirs.
Every day consisted of the same routine.
before heading towards his school,
he would stand for several moments in front of the mirror,
convincing himself that today was the day.
That was something he read in one of the books left behind by his mother.
"The Art of Positive Thinking,"
the title read,
in bright alluring colors,
designed to catch the reader's attention.
Kai was a hard sell.
His convincing never survived beyond the front door,
and he was left with no motivation to get to school.
Nevertheless,
he forced himself to go.
he promised his mother he would.
School was where those three ruled.
they did as they pleased,
and not even the teachers dared get in their way.
